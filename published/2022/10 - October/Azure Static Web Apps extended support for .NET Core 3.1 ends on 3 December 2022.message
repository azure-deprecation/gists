Since the managed functions hosted by Azure Static Web Apps run on Azure Functions, we recommend you update your functions applications toâ€¯[runtime version 4.x, which uses .NET 6](https://aka.ms/functions-supported-version).\r\n>\r\n> .NET 6 is the latest version with long-term support and provides these enhancements:\r\n>\r\n> - A unified set of base libraries and an SDK that makes it easy to share code across any application type.\r\n> - Simplified development with new C# 10 features and minimal APIs.\r\n> - Hot reload that allows you to make code changes without explicit recompiling.",
