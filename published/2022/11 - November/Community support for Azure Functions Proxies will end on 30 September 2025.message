It also provides advanced tools for building and maintaining APIs such as OpenAPI integration, rate limiting and exhaustive policy support. \r\n> \r\n> Azure Functions Proxies are a very limited subset of these capabilities that will no longer be invested in to avoid duplication of functionality. Azure Functions Proxies will continue to remain in maintenance mode until **30 September 2025** after which they will no longer be supported.\r\n> \r\n> To enable seamless upgrade of Function applications to runtime V4.x, we will be adding Proxy support back in Functions runtime V4.x by October 2022. However, migrating away from Proxies is strongly recommended.",
