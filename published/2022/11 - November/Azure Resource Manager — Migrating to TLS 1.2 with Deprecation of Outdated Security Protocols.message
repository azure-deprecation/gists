As such, to avoid any interruptions in your connections with Azure, we highly recommend that you migrate to TLS 1.2 and remove any dependencies on older protocols in your operating systems and work environments. \r\n>\r\n> Azure Resource Manager already supports TLS 1.2; customers currently using this version will be unaffected by this move. However, we will require HTTPS connections coming from all customers to use TLS 1.2, and we will no longer provide backwards compatibility to older security protocols.",
