        "OfficialReport": "> Azure ND-series virtual machines, powered by NVIDIA Tesla P40 GPUs, have been replaced by newer GPUs which offer dramatically increased performance and support for newer CUDA compute capability levels above 6.1. For instance, NC T4 v3 VMs offer 2-5x the effective throughput at a lower cost per GPU for workloads that can leverage new architectural features. ND-series virtual machine sizes will be retired on 31 August 2022. \r\n> \r\n> After 31 August 2022, any remaining ND virtual machines on your subscription will be set to a deallocated state, cease to be available, and will no longer incur billing charges.\r\n> \r\n> Note: This VM size retirement only impacts the VM sizes in the original NC, ND, and NC v2-series powered by Keppler and Pascal GPUs. (K80, P40, and P100) This retirement announcement does not apply to the newer NC v3, NC T4 v3, and ND v2-Series virtual machines.",
